  Add a community GitHub repository to the seedr registry.
  Trigger on: "/add-community <github-url>", "add community repo", "register community plugin/skill".
  Accepts a GitHub repo URL, fetches metadata via GitHub API (plugin.json or SKILL.md),
  detects content type, builds a file tree, asks clarifying questions, and updates
  registry/manifest.json. No local file copy — uses externalUrl for install-time fetching.

# Add Community

Add a community GitHub repository to the seedr registry.

## Workflow

### 1. Parse the GitHub URL

Extract `owner/repo` from the URL. Accepted formats:
- `https://github.com/owner/repo`
- `https://github.com/owner/repo/tree/main/subpath` (for items nested in a repo)
- `owner/repo` (shorthand)

Normalize to `owner` and `repo` variables. If a subpath is present, store it as `basePath` (default: repo root).

### 2. Detect content type via GitHub API

Use `gh api` to inspect the repo. Check in this order:

**Marketplace** (repos containing multiple plugins):
```bash
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/contents/{basePath}/.claude-plugin/marketplace.json --jq '.content' | base64 -d
```
If `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` exists, this is a **marketplace**. Parse the JSON and proceed to **step 2a** below.

**Plugin** (most common for full repos):
```bash
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/contents/{basePath}/.claude-plugin/plugin.json --jq '.content' | base64 -d
```
If `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` exists, this is a **plugin**. Parse the JSON for metadata.

**Skill** (for single-skill repos or subpath pointing to a skill):
```bash
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/contents/{basePath}/SKILL.md --jq '.content' | base64 -d
```
If `SKILL.md` exists, this is a **skill**. Parse YAML frontmatter for name/description.

**Ambiguous**: If neither is found, ask the user with AskUserQuestion what type it is.

### 2a. Marketplace handling

When a marketplace is detected, each sub-plugin is added as a **separate registry item**. Do NOT create a single item for the marketplace root — the root-level files (CLAUDE.md, .claude/, etc.) are marketplace development files, not a plugin.

**marketplace.json format:**
```json
{
  "name": "marketplace-name",
  "plugins": [
    {
      "name": "plugin-a",
      "description": "...",
      "author": { "name": "..." },
      "source": "./plugins/plugin-a"
    },
    {
      "name": "plugin-b",
      "description": "...",
      "author": { "name": "..." },
      "source": "./plugins/plugin-b"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Processing each sub-plugin:**

1. Parse `marketplace.json` — extract the `plugins` array
2. Tell the user: "This is a marketplace with N plugins:" followed by each plugin's name and description from marketplace.json
3. Ask: "Add all N plugins?" (Yes/Select specific ones)
4. For each selected plugin:
   a. Resolve `source` path relative to basePath (e.g., `./plugins/foo` → `plugins/foo`)
   b. Set the sub-plugin's `basePath` to this resolved path
   c. Derive `slug` from the directory name (last segment of source path, e.g., `plugins/foo` → `foo`)
   d. Fetch metadata from the sub-plugin's own `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`:
      ```bash
      gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/contents/{basePath}/{source}/.claude-plugin/plugin.json --jq '.content' | base64 -d
      ```
   e. Set `externalUrl` to `https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/tree/main/{resolved-source-path}`
   f. Proceed with steps 3–8 for this sub-plugin (file tree, dates, classification, descriptions, write item.json)
5. After all sub-plugins are processed, compile manifest once:
   ```bash
   npx tsx scripts/compile-manifest.ts
   ```

**Important marketplace notes:**
- Each sub-plugin gets its own `item.json` in `registry/plugins/{slug}/`
- Each has its own `externalUrl` pointing to the sub-plugin subdirectory, NOT the marketplace root
- Compatibility questions can be asked once and shared across all sub-plugins (plugins are typically `["claude"]`)
- Description questions (step 6) must be asked per-plugin — each has different content
- The community sync script (`community.ts`) refreshes each sub-plugin independently via its `externalUrl`

### 3. Extract metadata

**From plugin.json:**
```json
{
  "name": "...",
  "description": "...",
  "author": { "name": "...", "url": "..." }
}
```

**From SKILL.md frontmatter:**
```yaml
---
name: ...
description: ...
---
```

Derive `slug` from the repo name (kebab-cased). For subpath items, use the last path segment.

### 4. Build file tree

Fetch the repo's directory structure via GitHub API:
```bash
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/contents/{basePath} --jq '.[].name'
```

Recursively build `FileTreeNode[]` (max depth 6). For each entry:
- If `type == "dir"`, recurse into it and add as `{ name, type: "directory", children: [...] }`
- If `type == "file"`, add as `{ name, type: "file" }`

For plugins, also parse the tree to populate `PluginContents`:
- `skills/` directory → list `.md` files as `contents.skills`
- `agents/` directory → list `.md` files as `contents.agents`
- `hooks/` directory → if `hooks.json` exists, fetch it and use trigger keys (`SessionStart`, `PreToolUse`, etc.) as `contents.hooks`
- `commands/` directory → list `.md` files as `contents.commands`
- `mcp-servers/` or `mcp-configs/` → list as `contents.mcpServers`
- Root-level `.mcp.json` → fetch it and extract top-level keys as MCP server names. Handles flat (`{ "name": {...} }`) and wrapped (`{ "mcpServers": { "name": {...} } }`) formats

### 5. Fetch last commit date

```bash
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/commits?per_page=1 --jq '.[0].commit.committer.date'
```

### 6. Ask clarifying questions

Use AskUserQuestion. Pre-fill from detected metadata.

**Batch 1 — Identity & compatibility:**

```
questions:
  - question: "Name for registry: '<auto-detected name>'?"
    header: "Name"
    options:
      - label: "<detected name> (Recommended)"
        description: "From plugin.json / SKILL.md"
      - label: "Custom name"
        description: "Enter your own name"

  - question: "Which AI tools is this compatible with?"
    header: "Compat"
    multiSelect: true
    options:
      - label: "All"
        description: "Compatible with claude, copilot, gemini, opencode, and codex"
      - label: "claude"
        description: "Anthropic Claude Code"
      - label: "copilot"
        description: "GitHub Copilot"
      - label: "gemini"
        description: "Google Gemini CLI"
      - label: "opencode"
        description: "OpenCode CLI"
      - label: "codex"
        description: "OpenAI Codex CLI"
```

Notes:
- If the user selects "All", expand to `["claude", "copilot", "gemini", "opencode", "codex"]` in the compatibility array.
- Plugins are generally Claude-only (`["claude"]`), since `.claude-plugin` is a Claude concept.
- Skills may be multi-tool compatible.
- Community items do NOT have targetScope (scope is only for Toolr items).

**Batch 2 — Descriptions:**

Do NOT blindly use the description from plugin.json or SKILL.md frontmatter. Instead, read the actual content files (README.md, SKILL.md body, plugin skills/agents) to understand what the item *really* does, then write TWO descriptions:

1. **`description`** — answers "What does this do?"
2. **`longDescription`** — answers "Should I install this?"

**`description` rules:**

A single sentence that tells the user what the extension is capable of.

- One clear sentence — naturally short because it focuses on the core capability
- Lead with what it *does*, not what it *is* ("Manage GitLab repos, MRs, and CI/CD pipelines from Claude Code" not "GitLab DevOps platform integration")
- No trigger instructions ("Use when..."), no title restatements ("X plugin for Claude")
- For well-known tools (GitHub, Slack, Linear, etc.): focus on what the integration *enables*, not what the tool itself is
- Must work at a glance in a list view — users scan, they don't read

**`longDescription` rules:**

Implementation-level detail that tells the user exactly what they're getting — specific files, component names, agent roles, and concrete counts.

- Name specific skills, agents, commands, MCP servers, and hooks included (e.g. "Ships with a function-analyzer agent and completeness checklists" not "includes analysis tools")
- Include exact counts: number of skills, agents, commands, rules, techniques
- Describe what the plugin enables concretely (e.g. "manage issues, create branches, review PRs, trigger CI pipelines" not "interact with GitHub")
- For well-known integrations, focus on *what operations are available*, not what the service itself does
- No filler, no marketing speak — just the implementation facts
- After reading this, the user should know exactly what agents/skills/commands they'll get
- 3-5 sentences, typically 40-70 words. The pre-commit hook enforces a minimum of 30 words.

**Examples of good description pairs:**

| description | longDescription |
|---|---|
| "Search Slack messages, read channels, and pull team discussions into context." | "Connects via Slack MCP server to search messages, list channels, read threads, and pull conversation history into context. Find prior decisions, debugging discussions, or relevant context without leaving Claude Code. Supports channel filtering, thread navigation, and full-text message search across your workspace." |
| "Hook creation toolkit that generates event-driven hooks from natural language rules." | "Hook creation toolkit with 4 commands (/hookify, /configure, /list, /help), a conversation-analyzer agent, a writing-rules skill, and a Python rule engine. Generates hooks for 5 event types: bash commands, file edits, prompt submissions, session stops, and a catch-all. Each hook can warn or block. Includes 4 example rules: console.log warnings, dangerous rm prevention, test requirements, and sensitive file protection." |
| "Build deep architectural context through ultra-granular code analysis before vulnerability hunting." | "Includes a function-analyzer agent and completeness checklists to ensure thorough coverage of every function before hunting bugs. Designed for security audits where understanding call chains, data flows, and trust boundaries is critical. The agent builds a complete architectural map before any vulnerability analysis begins." |

**Examples of bad longDescriptions:**

- "Find prior decisions and relevant conversations without leaving Claude Code." (too vague — doesn't name what's included or how)
- "Interact with web pages and run test workflows." (says nothing about agents, commands, or approach)
- "Comprehensive Stripe integration for development." (marketing speak, no specifics)

Then present both descriptions to the user:

```
questions:
  - question: "Use these descriptions?\n\nShort: '<description>'\n\nDetailed: '<longDescription>'"
    header: "Description"
    options:
      - label: "Yes, use them (Recommended)"
        description: "Accept both descriptions"
      - label: "Edit them"
        description: "Provide your own"
```

### 7. Check for duplicates

Before adding, check if `registry/<type>s/<slug>/item.json` already exists.

If found, warn the user and ask: **Update existing** or **Abort**.

### 8. Write item.json and compile manifest

Create the directory and write `registry/<type>s/<slug>/item.json`:

```bash
mkdir -p registry/<type>s/<slug>
```

Item shape:

```json
{
  "slug": "<slug>",
  "name": "<confirmed name>",
  "type": "<detected type>",
  "description": "<short description>",
  "longDescription": "<detailed description>",
  "compatibility": ["<from user>"],
  "sourceType": "community",
  "pluginType": "<package|wrapper|integration>",
  "wrapper": "<extension type if wrapper>",
  "package": { "<type>": <count>, ... },
  "author": {
    "name": "<from plugin.json or repo owner>",
    "url": "<author url or github profile>"
  },
  "externalUrl": "https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/tree/main/{basePath}",
  "updatedAt": "<last commit date ISO 8601>",
  "contents": {
    "files": [<file tree>]
  }
}
```

Notes:
- Community items do NOT include `targetScope` — that field is only for Toolr items.
- `contents` only has `files` (the file tree). Extension counts go in `package` instead.
- Only include `pluginType`-specific fields: `wrapper` for wrappers, `package` for packages. Omit the other.

**Plugin classification** — after building the file tree, classify the plugin:

Count extension types by scanning root-level and `.claude/` subdirectories:
- `skills/` → count `.md` files or skill directories
- `agents/` → count `.md` files or agent directories
- `commands/` → count `.md` files or command directories
- `hooks/` → if `hooks.json` exists, fetch it and count trigger keys. Otherwise count hook scripts
- `mcp-servers/` or `.mcp.json` → count MCP servers. Also check `plugin.json` for `mcpServers` field

Then classify:
- **0 or 1 extension types** with single item → `pluginType: "wrapper"`, `wrapper: "<type>"` (e.g., `"mcp"`, `"hook"`, `"skill"`)
- **Multiple extension types** → `pluginType: "package"`, `package: { "skill": N, "agent": N, ... }`
- **No extensions, only docs** → ask user if this is an `integration` (e.g., LSP setup guide)

Write with `JSON.stringify(item, null, 2) + "\n"`.

Then recompile the manifest:
```bash
npx tsx scripts/compile-manifest.ts
```

### 9. Confirm

Print summary:
- Type, slug, name, author
- Number of skills, agents, hooks, etc. (for plugins)
- `externalUrl`
- Remind user to commit and push

## Important notes

- **No local file copy** — community items are metadata-only in the manifest. The CLI/web fetches content from `externalUrl` at install time.
- `sourceType` is `"community"`, same as Anthropic's synced community plugins. The sync script (`scripts/sync.ts`) preserves manually-added community items by checking slugs — if a community item's slug doesn't match any freshly synced item, it survives the sync.
- **Marketplace sub-plugins** are regular community items. Each has its own `externalUrl` pointing to the sub-plugin subdirectory. The community sync refreshes each independently. No special `marketplace` field is needed.
- GitHub API rate limits: unauthenticated = 60 req/hr, authenticated (gh cli) = 5000 req/hr. Using `gh api` ensures authenticated access.
- Build file trees with max depth 6 to capture nested plugin structures.
