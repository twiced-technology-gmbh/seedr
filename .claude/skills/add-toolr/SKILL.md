# Add Toolr Item

Add a new item to the seedr registry from a local filesystem path.

## Workflow

### 1. Parse the argument

Extract `<path>` from the user's input (e.g. `/add-toolr /Users/daniel/whatever/.claude/hooks/abc`).
Verify the path exists (file or directory) using Bash `ls` or Read.

### 2. Detect content type

Infer `ComponentType` from the path. Use the **deepest matching** segment:

| Path contains | Type |
|---|---|
| `/skills/` or file named `SKILL.md` | `skill` |
| `/hooks/` | `hook` |
| `/agents/` | `agent` |
| `/plugins/` or `.claude-plugin/` | `plugin` |
| `/mcp/` or `.mcp.json` | `mcp` |
| `/settings/` or `settings.json` | `settings` |
| `/commands/` | `command` |

If ambiguous, ask the user with AskUserQuestion.

### 3. Derive a default slug

From the path's final meaningful segment (directory name or filename without extension), kebab-case it.
Example: `/Users/daniel/whatever/.claude/hooks/pre-commit-lint` -> slug `pre-commit-lint`.

### 4. Ask clarifying questions

Use AskUserQuestion to collect metadata. Ask in batches to minimize round-trips.

**Batch 1 — Identity & scope:**

```
questions:
  - question: "What name should this <type> have in the registry?"
    header: "Name"
    options:
      - label: "<auto-derived name>"  # Title-cased from slug
        description: "Auto-derived from the path"
      - label: "Custom name"
        description: "Enter a custom display name"

  - question: "What scope should this install to?"
    header: "Scope"
    options:
      - label: "project (Recommended)"
        description: "Install into the current project directory"
      - label: "user"
        description: "Install into the user's home config"
      - label: "local"
        description: "Install into .local config (Claude only)"

  - question: "Which AI tools is this compatible with?"
    header: "Compat"
    multiSelect: true
    options:
      - label: "All"
        description: "Compatible with claude, copilot, gemini, opencode, and codex"
      - label: "claude"
        description: "Anthropic Claude Code"
      - label: "copilot"
        description: "GitHub Copilot"
      - label: "gemini"
        description: "Google Gemini CLI"
      - label: "opencode"
        description: "OpenCode CLI"
      - label: "codex"
        description: "OpenAI Codex CLI"
```

Notes:
- If the user selects "All", expand to `["claude", "copilot", "gemini", "opencode", "codex"]` in the compatibility array.
- For hooks, agents, settings, and commands, default compatibility to `["claude"]` only since those types are Claude-specific. Pre-select accordingly.

**Batch 2 — Description:**

After the user answers batch 1, read the source content to auto-generate a description.
Then ask:

```
questions:
  - question: "Use this description? '<auto-generated description>'"
    header: "Description"
    options:
      - label: "Yes, use it"
        description: "Accept the auto-generated description"
      - label: "Edit it"
        description: "Provide your own description"
```

### 5. For hooks: Extract triggers from settings

If the detected type is `hook` and the path points to a `.sh` script file:

1. Find the parent `.claude/` directory from the script path
2. Read both `settings.json` and `settings.local.json` in that directory
3. Search the `hooks` object for entries that reference this script file
4. Extract all triggers (event + matcher combinations)

Example settings.json structure:
```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      { "matcher": "Bash", "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": ".claude/hooks/my-hook.sh" }] },
      { "matcher": "Write", "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": ".claude/hooks/my-hook.sh" }] }
    ]
  }
}
```

From this, extract triggers:
```json
[
  { "event": "PreToolUse", "matcher": "Bash" },
  { "event": "PreToolUse", "matcher": "Write" }
]
```

Match the script by comparing the filename at the end of the command path.

### 6. Copy content to registry

Based on the detected type:

- **skill**: Copy directory to `registry/skills/<slug>/`. Expect a `SKILL.md` inside.
- **hook**: Copy the `.sh` script file to `registry/hooks/<slug>/`.
- **agent**: Copy `.md` file to `registry/agents/<slug>/`.
- **plugin**: Copy directory to `registry/plugins/<slug>/`.
- **mcp**: Copy config to `registry/mcp/<slug>/`.
- **settings**: Copy config to `registry/settings/<slug>/`.
- **command**: Copy to `registry/commands/<slug>/`.

Create the target directory if it doesn't exist. Use `cp -r` for directories, `cp` for files.

### 7. Build file tree for manifest

After copying, build a `FileTreeNode[]` from the copied content. Walk the directory recursively:

```
FileTreeNode = { name: string, type: "file" | "directory", children?: FileTreeNode[] }
```

Use `find <dir> | sort` and parse the output to build the tree.

### 8. Write item.json and compile manifest

Write the item metadata as `registry/<type>s/<slug>/item.json`:

```json
{
  "slug": "<slug>",
  "name": "<name from user>",
  "type": "<detected type>",
  "description": "<description>",
  "compatibility": ["<from user answers>"],
  "sourceType": "toolr",
  "author": { "name": "Toolr Suite", "url": "https://github.com/toolr-suite" },
  "externalUrl": "https://github.com/twiced-technology-gmbh/seedr/tree/main/registry/<type>s/<slug>",
  "updatedAt": "<current ISO 8601 date>",
  "contents": { "files": [<file tree>] },
  "targetScope": "<scope from user>"
}
```

**For hooks**, also include triggers in the `contents` object:

```json
{
  "contents": {
    "files": [{ "name": "my-hook.sh", "type": "file" }],
    "triggers": [
      { "event": "PreToolUse", "matcher": "Bash" },
      { "event": "PreToolUse", "matcher": "Write" }
    ]
  }
}
```

Write with `JSON.stringify(item, null, 2) + "\n"`.

Then recompile the manifest:
```bash
npx tsx scripts/compile-manifest.ts
```

### 9. Confirm

Print a summary:
- Type, slug, name
- Path copied to
- `item.json` written and manifest compiled
- Remind user to commit and push

## Important notes

- `sourceType` is always `"toolr"` — this skill is for manually-maintained items only
- The sync script (`pnpm sync`) preserves toolr items and only replaces synced items
- If `registry/<type>s/<slug>/item.json` already exists, warn the user and ask whether to update or abort
- For skills, validate that a `SKILL.md` exists in the source directory
- `featured` defaults to `false` — do not set it unless the user asks
