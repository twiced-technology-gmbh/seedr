  "longDescription": "Vercel's web interface design guidelines condensed into a single SKILL.md reference. Reviews UI code for accessibility compliance, UX patterns, responsive design, interaction design, and visual consistency. Catches common issues in HTML, CSS, and component markup -- missing ARIA attributes, poor contrast ratios, non-semantic markup, broken keyboard navigation -- before they reach production. No additional scripts or dependencies.",
