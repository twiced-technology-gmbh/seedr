  "longDescription": "Reference for creating Claude Code agents (subagents) stored as markdown files in `.claude/agents/`. Documents all 10 frontmatter fields (tools, model, `permissionMode`, `maxTurns`, memory, hooks, skills, `mcpServers`, `disallowedTools`), 6 permission modes, 3 model tiers with cost/accuracy tradeoffs, and the full agent lifecycle (spawn, execute, return, resume). Includes 7 ready-made agent patterns (code reviewer, test writer, debugger, doc generator, security auditor, architecture reviewer, explorer), 4 orchestration strategies (leader, pipeline, swarm, council), and coverage of Agent Teams for multi-instance collaboration. Ships with two reference docs: `memory-and-hooks.md` for persistent memory and lifecycle hooks, and `patterns-and-teams.md` for common configurations.",
