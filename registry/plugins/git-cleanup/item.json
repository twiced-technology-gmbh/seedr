  "description": "Analyze and safely clean up accumulated local git branches and worktrees by categorizing them as merged, squash-merged, superseded, or active.",
  "longDescription": "Plugin with a single `git-cleanup` skill invoked via `/git-cleanup`. Categorizes local branches into safe-to-delete (merged), needs-review (`[gone]` remotes), theme-related groups, and active work with unpushed commits. Uses a two-gate confirmation workflow: analysis review, then deletion approval. Applies `git branch -d` for merged branches and `git branch -D` only for verified squash-merges. Protects main, master, develop, and `release/*` branches, and blocks worktree removal when uncommitted changes exist.",
