  "description": "Comprehensive feature development workflow with specialized agents for codebase exploration, architecture design, and quality review",
  "longDescription": "Adds a /feature-dev command that orchestrates a 7-phase workflow: discovery, codebase exploration, clarifying questions, architecture design, implementation, quality review, and summary. Dispatches 3 agents (code-explorer, code-architect, code-reviewer) in parallel at key phases -- exploration launches 2-3 agents targeting similar features, patterns, and conventions; architecture compares minimal, clean, and pragmatic approaches; review checks simplicity, correctness, and conventions.",
