  "longDescription": "Provides a `frontend-design` skill that steers Claude toward intentional UI/UX choices rather than generic defaults. Covers typography and font selection, color systems via CSS variables, motion and scroll-triggered animations, spatial composition (asymmetry, overlap, grid-breaking), and visual depth techniques. Works with vanilla HTML/CSS, React, Vue, and other frameworks, scaling complexity to match the chosen aesthetic direction.",
